<p>I'm currently an analyst at <b><a href="https://impact.economist.com/">The Economist</a></b> in their health practice.</p>

<p>I previously did my Ph.D. in Public Health at the School of Public Health in The University of Hong Kong in the field of infodemiology. I was supervised by Professors Gabriel M. Leung and Karen A. Gr√©pin. Please see the <b><a href="https://jasonyin.com/academia">Academics</a></b> tab for my work. </p>

<p>I also travel, learn languages, rollerblade, and try new things. Check out the <b><a href="https://jasonyin.com/projects">Personal Projects</a></b> tab on the left.
