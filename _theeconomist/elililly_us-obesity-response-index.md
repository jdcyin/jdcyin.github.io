<p>
The United States Obesity Response Index assesses statesâ€™ approaches to addressing obesity. While there are plenty of examples of good obesity policy, their existence is uneven within and across states. The Index identifies where policy intervention is needed across the US and in each state, highlighting where states can learn from each other.</p>
