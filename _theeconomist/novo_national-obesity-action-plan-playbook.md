<p>In 2024, Economist Impact wrote <i>The Science of Obesity</i>, a series of papers exploring common misconceptions around obesity.</p>

<p>The National Obesity Action Plan Playbook builds on thse findings. It provides policymakers with a practical framework for designing and strengthening national strategies to prevent and manage obesity. Drawing on WHO guidance, global expertise, and case studies, it identifies key action areas and highlights best practices for tackling obesityâ€™s systemic drivers through a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.</p>
