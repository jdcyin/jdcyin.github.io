<p>The Obesity Response Index evaluates how countries work to prevent and manage obesity. It highlights national action—and inaction—across 30 indicators grouped into four pillars to assess the obesity policy landscape in each country; the availability and affordability of holistic obesity management; access to affordable, nutritious food at home and in schools; and access to opportunities for physical activity for all ages.</p>
