<p>Dengue defence is a research programme by Economist Impact, supported by Takeda. Based on regional workshops, global best practices and WHO guidelines, it offers practical, experience-based insights to support peer learning and guide implementation from national policies to local action. Its aim is to help countries move beyond short-term crisis management towards sustained, proactive dengue prevention.</p>
